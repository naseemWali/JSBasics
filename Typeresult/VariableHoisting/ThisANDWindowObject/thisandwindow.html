        // It creates when code runs a global object is created along with global execution context and also a this Global variable is created

        // we dont need to put this or window with every fxn or variable to access value because it knows and it assumes that we are getting value from  global scope .
        // examples

        //  var x=10;
          // console.log(window.x);

// console.log(window.y);
